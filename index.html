            <h2>Sir Isaac Newton</h2>
            <p class="first">
              Sir Isaac Newton (born 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726) was an English mathematician,
              physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author widely recognised as one of
              the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential
              scientists. He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the
              Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica , first published
              in 1687, established classical mechanics.
            </p>
            <p class="second">
              In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that
              formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of
              relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's
              laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the
              precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena,

            <p class="first">
              Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and
              businessman. He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation,
              mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which
              include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric
              light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world.
            </p>
            <p class="second">
              Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career, he worked as a
              telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he
              established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his
              early inventions were developed. He later established a botanical laboratory in Fort
              Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone,
              and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film
              studio.

            <p class="first">
              Nikola Tesla (born 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor,
              electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his
              contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply
              system.
            </p>
            <p class="second">
              Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the
              1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s
              working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In
              1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He
              worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck
              out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set
              up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and
              mechanical devices.

            <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p class="first">
              Albert Einstein (born 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical
              physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential
              physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of
              relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory
              of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of
              modern physics.
            </p>
            <p class="second">
              In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein
              published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric
              effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated
              mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could
              no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to
              develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational
              fields.

              Marie Salomea Skłodowska–Curie (born 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish and
              naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on
              radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the
              only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in
              two scientific fields.
            </p>
            <p class="second">
              She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian
              Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical
              scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister
              Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her
              subsequent scientific work.Under her direction, the world's first studies were
              conducted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes.
